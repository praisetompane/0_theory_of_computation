def: theoricatical foundations of computing systems

core areas:
    - automata theory
    - complexity theory
    - computability theory
        they are linked by this question:
            What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?

    - automata: deals with definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation
        the models are used in several areas of applied computer science
        models:
            - finiite automaton - text processing, compilers and hardware design
            - context free grammar - programming languages and artificial intelligence

    - complexity: What makes some problems computationally hard and others easy?
    - computability: What makes some problems solvable and others not solvable by computers.
